# Bias_Variance_Trade_Off_Code_Example
This repository demonstrates the fundamental bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning using polynomial regression. Through interactive code and visualizations, it shows how model complexity affects underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance), with clear metrics like MSE and RÂ² scores. Ideal for understanding ML fundamentals!
